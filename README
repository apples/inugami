README

Inugami is a framework designed for rapid prototyping of games.

Inugami is intended for small projects, however, it scales very well, and should make a good base for any project.

Please note that Inugami is built for my personal needs, and may not be suitable for every project.

As of this writing, Inugami is INCOMPLETE and may contain several errors. If you plan on using Inugami in your own project, please consider contacting me for usability information.

Current features are:
    OBJ model loading
    Texture loading
    Shader loading
    Scheduler
    Math and utilities
    Keyboard and mouse input handler
    2D sprite handler
    
Current limitations are:
    Models do not support animation
    No support for 3D textures
    No abstraction of OpenGL
    No default shader (fixed pipeline)
    
Note that Inugami is only meant for graphics, and other systems, such as audio, networking, and physics, must be found elsewhere.

COMPILING:

Inugami depends on the following software libraries:
    DevIL   1.7.8
    GLEW    1.9.0
    GLFW    3.0
    
I've been tweaking the framework so much that I just compile the sources with my project, but it should work just fine as a static library or DLL or whatever. I recommend using the sandbox project as a template.

BASIC USAGE:

Include "inugami/inugami.h" for the full package.

You must create a Core to use the framework.
It is recommended to use the scheduler via Core::addCallback(...).
If a callback has a negative frequency, it is called as often as possible.

The Interface will help you process input, but is not necessary.
If used, make sure to call Interface::poll() regularly.

All GLFW and OpenGL functions should work as normal.
It is recommended to start drawing with Core::beginFrame() and end with Core::endFrame().
It is also recommended to use Core::setMode(...) to set up the camera.

Currently, transformations must still be done using the old OpenGL functions (glTranslate, glRotate, etc.). If using a shader, data must be uploaded manually.

Texture images are loaded when a Texture object is created. If a texture file has already been loaded, the resource is shared.

Please see the sandbox project for a decent example of usage.
